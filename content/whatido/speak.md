I speak in conferences, events and workshops. 

My expertise is system localization and language support. I speak about these general topics:

* *Localization*: supporting your user no matter where they are
* Technical aspect of *language support* and translations
* *Open Source* and developing Wikipedia in the open
* Supporting *non-Left to Right* languages when developing products

If you want to invite me to speak in your event, please use the [contact page](/contact).
